# Linear Regression Housing prediction
My implementation of linear regression from scratch with C++. It's done using an algorithm called Batch Gradient Descent and 500 000 iterations of it. The learning rate is set to 0.00004. This program predicts the price of a house based on its size (in mÂ²). The training dataset is manually imported from current sell offers in the location Rusovce - Bratislava, Slovakia.

# The prediction:
After 500 000 iterations of Batch Gradient Descent this is the linear function that predicts the price of houses from the training dataset:
  y = 662.872x + 502517
